class Solution:
    # Inspired from the solution of Bakerston
    # Basically we make an array to store nums in increasing order and find what is the size of the LIS ending there
	# Our array is 0 to max element from the given nums
    # We need to find the elements smaller than n till the limit k which are in nums before this num
    # so simply all the elements previous to our current num are smaller(till k smaller)
    # now how to find LIS's size?
    # Since we are updating elements left to right in our array we know the LIS's size of elements smaller
    # than our current num
    # we just need to find the largest LIS size in range (num - k, num) from our array
    # This is a range query and can be efficiently answered using Segment Trees.
